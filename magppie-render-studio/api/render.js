// api/render.js
//
// Vercel serverless function for Magppie Render Studio (OpenAI build).
//
// Staged guardrail pipeline for faithful renders:
//   1. Analyze  - a vision pass reads the uploaded kitchen's exact layout.
//   2. Compose  - that becomes a strict "keep this layout, change only these
//                 surfaces" instruction.
//   3. Edit     - gpt-image-2 renders at high input fidelity.
//   4. Verify   - a vision pass compares the render to the original and reports
//                 whether the layout held.
//
// Steps 1 and 4 degrade gracefully: if they fail, the render still returns.
// Only OPENAI_API_KEY is needed.

Warm under-cabinet LED washes down the backsplash and across the countertop. Warm under-counter LED runs beneath the worktop front overhang and glows onto the cabinetry below. A warm skirting LED at the plinth casts a soft pool of light onto the floor along the full run of cabinets. Warm in-cabinet LED lights the interiors and shelves of the glass-fronted and open brass-framed cabinets so they glow from within. Balance the warm accents against the neutral daylight so the overall image reads bright, warm, and realistic, with soft shadows and gentle reflections on the polished stone."
